# cloudlife

Xscreensaver hacks and other beautiful programs with Dear ImGui

## using with sway

```
exec swayidle \
    timeout 240 "swaymsg exec 'cloudlife -a 8 -S'" \
    resume "swaymsg exec 'killall cloudlife'"
```

Some sway configuretion regarding window placement shold be done.

Instead of directly calling `cloudlife` some bash script sohould
be used and `-a` number is chosen randomly from preferred screensavers.
TODO: support multiple monitors via filtering by title. How to
place a window in current workspace on certain output in sway config?
