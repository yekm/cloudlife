Version 0.1 - Sometime in '95:
I was working on a programming project for one of my classes and decided to
take a break and play around with SVGALib a little bit. A rough version of
acidworm resulted. It was put on the backburner for many months. 

Version 0.2 - Around December '96:
Due to repeated "Wow, that's cool!" and "Woah!" blurts from friends, I hacked
away at it some more. I made it a little more user friendly and robust. There
are probably little buglets floating around there since I haven't given it the
Unholy Fist of Beta Testing. 

That's what the world is for. 
Beat this program until it begs for mercy. Find the bugs, and send me patches.
